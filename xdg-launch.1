.TH XDG-LAUNCH 1 "April 2025" "1.0" "XDG Launcher"

.SH NAME
xdg-launch \- Enforces XDG Base Directory compliance for applications.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xdg-launch
[\fB\-cd\fR \fIdirectory\fR]
[\fB\-\-fuzz\fR]
.IR application
[\fB\-\- \fIoptions\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xdg-launch
is a shell script designed to enforce the XDG Base Directory Specification for
applications that do not respect the user's XDG settings. By temporarily
redefining the \fIHOME\fR environment variable and linking necessary files,
it fools applications into storing their configuration, cache, and data files
in the appropriate XDG-defined locations.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-d, \--dir, \--cd \fIdirectory\fR
Specify a working directory for the application.
The script will change to this directory before launching the application.

.TP
.B \-f, \--fuzz
Fuzz the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file for applications that ignore environment variables.
This enables namespace isolation and maps the fake root user's home directory to \fIXDG_DATA_HOME\fR.
This ensures compatibility for applications that target on \fI/etc/passwd\fR for determining the home directory.

.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Display usage information and exit.

.TP
.I application
The application to be launched. This is required.

.TP
.I options
Any additional options or arguments passed to the application must follow the 
.B --
separator.

.SH HOW IT WORKS

.TP
Environment Setup:
The script checks for user-defined \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR, \fBXDG_CACHE_HOMEfR,
and \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR. If they are not defined, default values are used.
Missing directories are created as needed.

.TP
Temporary Links:
Temporary links are created within \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR for the user's
cache, config, and Xauthority.

.TP
/etc/passwd Fuzzing (if enabled):
A copy of the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file is created as \fI/tmp/passwd.fuzz-$USER\fR.
Within this file, the root user's home directory is set to the real user's \fIXDG_DATA_HOME\fR.

.TP
Application Launch:
The script changes the working directory (if specified), redefines the
\fBHOME\fR environment variable to point to \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR, and
launches the specified application with its arguments.
If enabled, this occurs within a new private namespace for fuzzing the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file.

.TP
Cleanup:
The temporary links are removed after the application exits.
Fuzzed passwd files are not removed from the \fI/tmp\fR directory, but will be overwritten each time.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME
Defines where user-specific configuration files should be stored. Defaults to 
.I ${HOME}/.config.

.TP
.B XDG_CACHE_HOME
Defines where user-specific cache files should be stored. Defaults to 
.I ${HOME}/.cache.

.TP
.B XDG_DATA_HOME
Defines where user-specific data files should be stored. Defaults to 
.I ${HOME}/.local/share.

.TP
.B XAUTHORITY
Specifies the path to the \fI.Xauthority\fR file used by X11 for authentication.

.SH NOTES
.PP
If you have an existing \fBXAUTHORITY\fR setting, the script will \fBnot\fR
create a temporary link for \fI.Xauthority\fR. It is expected that your setting
works without modification.
Please let the author know if this is, in fact, true or not.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The launcher returns the exit code of the target application.

.SH FILES
.PP
The following directories and files are used:
.TP
.I $HOME/.config:
Default location for configuration files.
.TP
.I $HOME/.cache:
Default location for cache files.
.TP
.I $HOME/.local/share:
Default location for data files.
.TP
.I $HOME/.Xauthority:
Used for X11 authentication.
